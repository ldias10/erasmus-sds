# Erasmus-sds Project
This Erasmus+ project aims to develop a platform, designed to assist Erasmus+ students in selecting courses for their Learning Agreement (LA). The main problem addressed by the project is the difficulty students face in deciding which courses to include in their LA. This sotware will offer features such as presenting a list of available courses with official descriptions, including links to ECTS details, as well as showcasing comments and reviews from other Erasmus+ students about the courses. Additionally, students can comment on courses, add materials, and create their Learning Agreement within the platform. They can manage their selection by adding or deleting courses to a virtual basket and export their finalized Learning Agreement as a document.
